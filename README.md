A configuration overview for my DXP2800 running TrueNAS

I recently bought a UGREEN DXP2800, which ships with UGOS, UGREEN’s “proprietary” Debian-based distribution. Since it’s unclear where the modifications to that OS are (and if are) published (which may be a GPL violation), I decided to go down the rabbithole and install TrueNAS instead.

This repository documents my setup, configuration choices, and any tweaks or workarounds needed to get TrueNAS running smoothly on this hardware.
