# Hardware Overview

This document provides a brief overview of the hardware used in my UGREEN DXP2800.

## Base System

- **Model:** UGREEN DXP2800
- **CPU:** Intel N100
- **Memory Type:** DDR5 SODIMM
- **Drive Bays:** 2 × 3.5" SATA (HDD)
- **Internal Storage:** 2 × NVMe SSD slot
- **Networking:** 2.5 GbE

## Memory Upgrade

- **Original RAM:** 8 GB DDR5
- **Current RAM:** 16 GB DDR5

I upgraded the RAM from 8 GB to 16 GB **early on**, back when DDR5 prices were actually something human (we miss u micron).
The upgrade provides more headroom, especially for ZFS caching, applications, I think it's an obligated update.
